###Purpose:
The main purpose of this app is to boost the workflow on the construction sites and save the time and effort that they spend in buying raw materials and equipment. In most cases, the raw material is not available at the required time due to which the work, unfortunately, has to stop which results in delays. Customers can order any desired material or equipment from the site just 2-3 days before and will get delivered in less amount of time. The time and effort of bringing raw materials and equipment to the construction site also take a lot of time. But, with the help of this, we can reduce the time taken by this effort and can have boosted workflow. People even with very basic knowledge of the internet can even use this platform and purchase any equipment or material from their homes.
